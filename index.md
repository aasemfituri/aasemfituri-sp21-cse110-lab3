## About Me
**I am a second year student at UCSD, who is planning on switching into CS and who is looking forward to learning the nuances and intricacies of developing more complex projects.**  

_Some of my hobbies include surfing, basketball, and playing video games._   
Here is a picture (not my own) of my favorite beach in San Diego, Del Mar.

My favorite 5 current-day NBA players in no particular order are:
- LeBron James 
- Chris Paul 
- Stephen Curry  
- Luka Doncic
- Giannis Antetokounmpo

I do not have any pets but if I were I would rather have a cat as opposed to a dog.

In general, I try to live my life by following the golden rule:  
> Treat others the way you want to be treated.  


## CS Background and Career Interests
I am not very experienced with developing larger projects as most of my work in CS has been related to simple programs related to school.   
***I have some knowledge of Java, C, C++, and the command line.***  
**Despite my lack of knowledge of relatively complex programs, I do find the whole concept of _AI/machine learning_ quite fascinating and would like to get into the field in the future.**  
I do not really have much experience in this field, but hopefully by the time I graduate I will have developed the skills necessary to enter this field.  

I do think that the completion of the following classes will help me build more complex projects in the future as well as help me get internships in the near future: 
- [x] CSE 100
- [ ] CSE 101
- [ ] CSE 110

Even though I learned some fundamental ideas in my previous classes such as the use of an `unordered_map` in C++, I believe that this class will help me transform this fundamental knowledge into something more concrete.

I think that in order to be successful in this class I will need to:
1. Watch the appropriate lectures
2. Communicate with my team
3. Ask questions when I am confused (both to my team and the instructors)
