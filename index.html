                    Friday was a busy but also a relatively fun day. I first had to attend a few classes and take care of some necessities. Later on in the day I took a <b>quiz</b> for CSE 101 (which wasn't too bad). After doing all this work, I had the chance to  <strong>hang out with some friends</strong> and play some basketball. The day ended with me playing some video games(or rather 1 video game) and then going to sleep.

                    Some of the things that happened on Friday were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go to class</li>
                        <li>Take CSE 101 quiz</li>
                        <li>Chill with friends</li>
                        <li>Play video games (or rather 1 game)</li>
                    </ul>

                        On Saturday, soon after I woke up I started working on this assignment and have been alternating between doing the assignment and playing some video games. I then met up with my team for the first and played some scribbl.io. A while after, a ate and watched some TV. And finally, I plan to end the day by working on/finishing this Lab and playing some more video games (well a video game).
